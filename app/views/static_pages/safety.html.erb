			<h1>Safety and Community Guidelines</h1>
			<p>At TimeSwappers, we take safe TimeSwapping seriously.</p>
			<p>We work hard to create and maintain a community of members who are helpful and trustworthy. Mutual accountability, member-sourced reviews and feedback are a core part of how we all improve the TimeSwapping experience.</p>
			<p>TimeSwappers who consistently receive poor reviews or violate our Terms of Service may lose their membership in the TimeSwappers community.</p>
			<p>If you have any concerns, share them by confidentially reporting negative experiences or safety issues to: <%= mail_to "help@timeswappers.com", "help@timeswappers.com" %>.</p>
